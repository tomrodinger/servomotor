The servomotor has comprehensive error detection and handling. If an error condition is detected then a fatal error condition will result. When this happens, the motor will immediately disable itself and the red LED will flash. The flashing LED will indicate the error code. You can count the pulses. You can also retrieve the error using the "Get Status" command. Once you know the error code, you can look it up in the section below to understand the root reason. The servomotor will not respond to most commands when it is in a fatal error state, only "Get Status" and "System Reset". You will need to reset the servomotor to get it back into a functional state. With careful programming, a fatal error should not be triggered. Nearly in all cases, if a fatal error occurs, it is for a good reason and most likely you will need to improve the way you try to use the motor.
