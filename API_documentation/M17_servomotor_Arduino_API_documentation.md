## Getting Started

This section provides a complete example showing how to control a servomotor with Arduino.

### Trapezoid Move Example

```cpp
// Minimal Arduino example: Trapezoid move using builtâ€‘in unit conversions
// Goal: spin the motor exactly 1 rotation in 1 second, then stop.
// Sequence:
//  enable MOSFETs -> trapezoidMove(1.0 rotations, 1.0 seconds) -> wait 1.1s -> disable MOSFETs.
//
// Notes:
// - This uses the library's unit conversion (no raw counts/timesteps).
// - Configure Serial1 pins for your board (ESP32 example pins below).
// - Motor is created AFTER Serial1.begin(...) so hardware UART pins are set first.

#include <Servomotor.h>

#define ALIAS 'X'                   // Device alias
#define BAUD 230400                 // RS485 UART baud rate
#define DISPLACEMENT_ROTATIONS 1.0f // 1 rotation
#define DURATION_SECONDS 1.0f       // 1 second
#define TOLERANCE_PERCENT 10        // +10% wait margin because the motor's clock is not
                                    //  perfectly accurate
#define WAIT_MS ((unsigned long)(DURATION_SECONDS * 1000.0f * (100 + TOLERANCE_PERCENT) / 100))

// Example RS485 pins for ESP32 DevKit (change as needed for your board)
#if defined(ESP32)
#define RS485_TXD 4              // TX pin to RS485 transceiver
#define RS485_RXD 5              // RX pin from RS485 transceiver
#endif

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200); // Console serial for debugging

  // Create the motor; serial port opens on first instantiation.
#if defined(ESP32)
  Servomotor motor(ALIAS, Serial1, RS485_RXD, RS485_TXD);
#else
  Servomotor motor(ALIAS, Serial1);
#endif

  // Use units: rotations for position, seconds for time
  motor.setPositionUnit(PositionUnit::SHAFT_ROTATIONS);
  motor.setTimeUnit(TimeUnit::SECONDS);

  motor.enableMosfets();
  motor.trapezoidMove(DISPLACEMENT_ROTATIONS, DURATION_SECONDS);
  delay(WAIT_MS);
  motor.disableMosfets();
}

void loop() {
}
```

```

#### Multimove

**Parameters:**
- `moveCount`: u8: Specify how many moves are being communicated in this one shot.

- `moveList`: list_2d: A 2D list in Python format (list of lists). Each item in the list is of type [i32, u32] representing a series of move commands. Each move command specifies the acceleration to move at or the velocity to instantly change to (according to the bits above) and the number of time steps over which this command is to be executed. For example: '[[100, 30000], [-200, 60000]]'. There is a limit of 32 move commands that can be listed in this one multi-move command. Each of the moves takes up one queue spot, so make sure there is enough space in the queue to store all of the commands.

**Example:**
```cpp
// Multimove
uint8_t moveCount = 1;
uint32_t moveTypes = 1000;
uint32_t moveList = 1000;

getCommunicationStatisticsResponse response = motor.getCommunicationStatistics(resetCounter);
```

## Error Handling

The servomotor has comprehensive error detection and handling. If an error condition is detected then a fatal error condition will result. When this happens, the motor will immediately disable itself and the red LED will flash. The flashing LED will indicate the error code. You can count the pulses. You can also retrieve the error using the "Get Status" command. Once you know the error code, you can look it up in the section below to understand the root reason. The servomotor will not respond to most commands when it is in a fatal error state, only "Get Status" and "System Reset". You will need to reset the servomotor to get it back into a functional state. With careful programming, a fatal error should not be triggered. Nearly in all cases, if a fatal error occurs, it is for a good reason and most likely you will need to improve the way you try to use the motor.

## Error Codes

This section lists all possible error codes that can be returned by the servomotor.
