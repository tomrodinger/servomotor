High level of integration combines a motor, motor driver, motion control system, and encoder
Control any number of motors from one simple controller over a RS-485 commincation interface
Control with high level commands such as "Emable mosfets" and "Trapezoid move" (avoid timing critical DIR/STEP control)
Compact form factor nearly the same size as a NEMA 17 stepper motor with the same specifications (no protrusions)
Standardized NEMA 17 mounting dimensions
Wide voltage range (12-24V) for flexible power options
High-precision closed loop control with build in encoder and PID control loop that runs at 32 kHz
Much more power efficient in closed loop control vs. conventional stepper
Integrated over-current, over-voltage, and over-temperature protection
Maximum speed can reach 560 RPM
Torque-to-weight ratio is the same as an equivalent stepper motor
Compatible with a wide variety of interfaces and hardware, such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, Mac, and PC
