We are an innovative startup committed to making precision motion control accessible to everyone: to makers, educators, and engineers alike. Founded in Shenzhen in 2022 by a Canadian entrepreneur, we focus on developing integrated servo motor systems that combine cost-effectiveness, high integration, ease of use, and high performance.
Our first product is the M17 series servo motor, which integrates a motor, driver, controller, and encoder into a compact NEMA 17â€“compatible package. It features RS-485 communication, which allows any number of motors to be controlled from a platform such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, Mac, or PC. Designed for applications ranging from educational robotics to industrial automation, our solutions enable innovation without adding the complexity or cost of traditional systems. Join us to explore the future of motion control!
