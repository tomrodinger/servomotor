The M17 Series Servomotors use RS-485 for communication, enabling multiple motors to be daisy-chained together. Each motor has a factory assigned 64-bit unique address so that it can be addressed individually on an RS-485 bus. Each motor can also be assigned a unique 1-byte alias (0-251) in order to save bytes in the communication packet and still get similar individual control. There is also a broadcast alias, which is 255.
The protocol supports a comprehensive set of commands for motion control, configuration, and status monitoring. Firmware update through the RS-485 interfce is supported.
Communication baud rate is fixed at 230400.
