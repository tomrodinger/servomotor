The M17 Series Servomotors are all-in-one motion control solutions that integrate a motor, motor driver, motion controller, and encoder in a single compact package. These servomotors feature a RS-485 communication interface, enabling multiple units to be daisy-chained together and controlled from a single connection point. Available in three models - M17-60, M17-48, and M17-40 - the series offers flexible options to match specific torque requirements while maintaining consistent control characteristics.

Each M17 Series Servomotor comes with sophisticated control features including multiple operation modes, self-calibration capabilities, and built-in status monitoring through LED indicators. The motors can be easily controlled from any platform including Mac, PC, Raspberry Pi, or Arduino (requiring only a low-cost RS485 adapter), making them ideal for both educational and industrial applications.

The series supports precise position control with trapezoid movement profiles, closed-loop control mode, and comprehensive error handling. With standardized NEMA 17 mounting dimensions, wide voltage range (12-24V), and robust communication protocol, M17 Series Servomotors provide a reliable and flexible solution for applications requiring precise motion control, from robotics and CNC machines to automated testing equipment and scientific instruments.
